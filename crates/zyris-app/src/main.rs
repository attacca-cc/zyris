//! Zyris: a desktop node for Attacca.
//!
//! This file picks a runtime and does nothing else. Both runtimes are handed the same
//! `EventBus`, because the difference between them is only whether anything is watching.
//!
//! The tokio runtime is built here, once, for both modes: from step 2 on, everything the core
//! owns — a websocket, reconnect, token refresh — is async, and in GUI mode it needs somewhere
//! to run since Tauri owns the main thread synchronously.
